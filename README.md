Rabbyt is a sprite library for Python with game development in mind.  It
provides fast performance with an easy to use but flexable API.

For a quick rundown on the current [features see the website](http://arcticpaint.com/projects/rabbyt/).

You can find the [reference documentation here](http://matthewmarshall.org/projects/rabbyt/docs/)

Examples and documentation are included in the source distribution, but not
the .eggs or windows installer.
